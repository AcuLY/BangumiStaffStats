## Capability Boundary

| Field | Boundary |
|---|---|
| Status | Approved startup/maintenance policy; apply requires complete strict-valid artifacts and primary review; implementation/verification not yet claimed |
| Owner | Backend implements lifecycle/cache/drain; parent owns specifications, docs, operations readiness wait and final acceptance |

| Read-only protected inputs | Pre-existing four HTTP handler edits and detached_deadline_test.go; all statistics evaluators/series representation, loaders' SQL/semantics, Archive bytes, contracts/goldens/generated files, userscript/frontend, other active changes, live services/state, remote refs |
| Deletion complement | Preserve every unrelated path, request/worker/collection timeout, fixture, statistical rule and existing regression; no broad deletion |
| Mutable refs | Current master worktree files only; no branch/worktree/ref switch or commit/push by apply owner |
| Consumes | Existing Store, series/fact loaders, public query contracts, process/update cancellation, current release resource settings |
| Produces | Prepared Store admission; bounded single-generation maintenance/recovery; exact-Store cache retirement; safe detached drain; startup-aware deploy wait |
| Dependencies | Existing standard library and packages only; explicit app -> query orchestration edge; no reverse imports/new dependency |
| Deliverables | Source, focused RED/GREEN/race evidence, full backend gate, reviewed/synced specs, real-data evidence |
| Acceptance | Tests and evidence in tasks.md; unchanged public success/error envelopes and statistical output; cold first query and activation/recovery under original caps |
| Non-goals | Index compression, statistical optimization, synthetic UID warmup, result precomputation, query budget/resource increases, new routes, frontend/userscript changes |
| Operations deferred | All live changes, publication/merge/release remain under the separate deploy-unrestricted-person-entry gate after acceptance; no live restart here |
| Stop/rollback conditions | Stop on unexpected dirty drift, result/wire drift, unsafe admission/drain, leaked generation, OOM, failed recovery, broader required ownership; preserve evidence and old production; patch owned files only |


## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Detached Store users SHALL remain visible through completion
The process runtime SHALL expose a lifecycle drain condition covering every detached Store user from before asynchronous scheduling through actual completion and publication. HTTP waiter cancellation SHALL NOT make outstanding shared work disappear. Coalescing SHALL NOT leak drain registrations or report idle while work can still access an old Store. Collection and result budgets, cache semantics and executor capacity SHALL remain unchanged. Maintenance SHALL close external admission before observing this condition.

#### Scenario: A waiter leaves before a callback starts
- **WHEN** the final HTTP waiter cancels after scheduling shared work but before its callback enters the executor
- **THEN** the runtime SHALL remain non-idle until the registered work finishes; old Store retirement SHALL wait

#### Scenario: Same-key work is coalesced
- **WHEN** multiple callers share a callback and some or all callers cancel
- **THEN** drain SHALL remain non-idle until real completion and SHALL become idle afterwards without leaked registrations or duplicate computation
