## Why

The screenshot review exposed generic rectangles, inconsistent initial/view loading, incomplete placeholders, stale detail geometry, and repeated gallery families. The user requests loading layouts that match their actual contents and a new review with exact duplicates omitted.

## What Changes

- Use a real loading selector while catalog data is pending.
- Replace generic deferred/initial query loaders with the corresponding ranking, candidate, partner or co-star structure; preserve independent request boundaries and error/retry behavior.
- Share ranking rows and actual column headings between initial and view waiting. Use real disabled search/sort controls and known summary labels; only unresolved backend values are skeletons.
- Replace whole-card rectangles with actual portrait/name/identity/metric/content structures for works, characters, candidates, partners and co-star analysis.
- Keep work/character/candidate/partner/co-star fixed text and controls real. Pagination remains the actual pending component when accepted data exists, and is absent without data. Whole Tag placeholders preserve complete tag dimensions.
- Preserve accepted ready geometry. Investigate padding in the actual parent layout; review screenshots include parent context to distinguish cropping from an application issue.
- Regenerate a deduplicated gallery, documenting the initial/view aliases covered by each identical skeleton family.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

None.

### Modified Capabilities

- `frontend-accessibility`: Contextual structural loading, NSkeleton ownership, accessible controls and pagination.
- `frontend-query-shell`: Catalog selector remains a recognizable loading control.
- `frontend-ranking-results`: Shared initial/view row layout and known column headings and dynamic metric placeholders.

## Impact

This is an INTENTIONAL_DELTA authorized by the user's 11 review comments. Ready layouts remain PRESERVE_ORACLE except explicitly requested loading presentation. It follows the implemented `frontend-fix-skeleton-shimmer-loop` baseline; that earlier change's remaining verification/lifecycle is not reopened. No other repository or external state is mutated.
